# TODO

* Exhaustiveness of struct should match the exhaustiveness of the rust type (controllable via the #[non_exhaustive] attribute)
* Rename all
* Examples cross product
* discriminator
* Named primitive schema
* DI container owned services (internal owned type -> copy/transform function -> external type)
* DI decorated services
* SchemaCollection -> RefCell intern
* Restructure json submodule: Merge with specification and rename to specification. Move the build function to the openapi module??
