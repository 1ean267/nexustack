use crate::{injection_error::ConstructionResult, injector::Injector};

// The injector is a non-send, non-sync type with a lifetime to ensure that it can not escape the
// [`FromInjector::from_injector`] factory function.

/// The implementing type is a service resolvable from an [`Injector`]. The provided injector can be
/// used to resolve dependencies of the implementing service
///
/// The provided `#[injectable]` macro can be used to auto-generate the implementation of this trait.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use nexustack_inject::ConstructionResult;
/// use nexustack_inject::FromInjector;
/// use nexustack_inject::Injector;
///
/// #[derive(Clone)]
/// pub struct DependencyA { }
///
/// #[derive(Clone)]
/// pub struct DependencyB { }
///
///
/// #[derive(Clone)]
/// pub struct MyService {
///     dependency_a: DependencyA,
///     dependency_b: DependencyB,
/// }
///
/// impl FromInjector for MyService {
///     fn from_injector(injector: &Injector) -> ConstructionResult<Self>
///         where
///             Self: Sized
///     {
